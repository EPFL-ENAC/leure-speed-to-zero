# - prefix+X: a small menu on the current session — plain kill, or wt-done.sh
#   (kill + remove the worktree + branch kept), with a

#   binding is server-wide and the last tmux-dev.sh to run owns it, whatever
#   repo it came from (bluecity-viz carries the same tooling), so it bakes no
#   script path in: wt-done.sh is resolved at key time from the pane's own
#   checkout, through the main checkout of that repo (the copy that survives
#   the worktree removal), and gets the branch from the pane's path (--path).
