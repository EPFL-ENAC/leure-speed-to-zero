# `wtgo <branch>` — go to a branch's dev session, creating whatever is missing
# (worktree, tmux session, even the branch). Same engine as `make go`; the
# function exists so bash can tab-complete branch names, which make cannot do
# for variable values. `wtdone <branch>` is the reverse: session + worktree
# gone, branch kept (scripts/wt-done.sh).
#
# Install once:  echo 'source ~/dev/speed-to-zero/scripts/wt-go.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
# Source this file ONCE, from any repo that has the tooling: the functions find
# the repo you are standing in, so one source line serves every ported repo.
# Standing somewhere else (your home directory, a repo without the tooling), the
# commands use WTGO_DEFAULT_REPO if you set it, else the repo this file lives
# in, and say so on stderr. To keep another repo as that default:
#   WTGO_DEFAULT_REPO=~/dev/speed-to-zero
#   source ~/dev/speed-to-zero/scripts/wt-go.bash
#
# Completion is two-tier: while your input matches an existing worktree, only
# worktrees are offered — a bare `wtgo <TAB>` is exactly "what was I working
# on". Only when nothing matches does it widen to every local and origin
# branch, minus the protected ones (never checked out in a worktree).

# The repo you are standing in, if it has the worktree tooling; else the default
# repo. From inside a worktree, git's common dir points back at the main
# checkout, which is where the scripts are run from anyway.
# Prints the path either way; returns 1 when it had to fall back, so the callers
# can say which repo they picked instead of acting on the wrong one silently.
