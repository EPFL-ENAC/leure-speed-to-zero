#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One command from branch name to a running, attached dev session — whether the
# branch is brand new, exists without a worktree, or already has one:
#   scripts/wt-new.sh <branch> [base=origin/<BASE_BRANCH>] [--model <branch>] [--prompt <file-or-text>] [--no-attach]
# (or: make go BRANCH=feat/x)
# wt create / wt checkout → .wt.toml hooks (deps, env, ports, detached tmux
# session) → attach. Detach with prefix+d; you land back where you started.
# --prompt writes a PROMPT.md at the worktree root and the session's claude pane
#   starts on it, on fable in plan mode, so you get a plan back to review (see
#   tmux-dev.sh). A readable file is copied, anything else is taken as the
#   literal prompt text. On a session that is already up the claude pane is
#   restarted on the brief; its previous conversation stays resumable.
# --model <branch> gives this worktree its own transition-compass-model worktree
#   on that branch (created if needed, with its own session), instead of the
#   model's main checkout which every other worktree shares read-only. Use it
#   when the task changes the model and the app together. It is remembered in
#   .env.worktree, so it only has to be passed once.
# --no-attach leaves the session detached, so several wtgo calls can run back
#   to back from one shell.
# Tab completion for branch names: source scripts/wt-go.bash (see the guide).
