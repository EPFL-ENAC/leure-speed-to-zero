For passenger travel, the proportion of car use in the mix is particularly important, as fossil-fuel powered cars have high emissions per person compared to public transport. Historically, car use increases as countries develop and cars become more affordable.</p>\n      <p>Although growth in car ownership has long been associated with increasing prosperity, a shift to public transport, walking or cycling does not necessarily mean less convenience for passengers and a lower quality of life. If cities are carefully planned with integrated transport systems, journeys may be quicker by public transport. Quality of life can be improved by spending less time stuck on congested roads.\nHowever, the development of public transport infrastructure and urban planning usually requires significant public investment, whereas the growth of car use involves the spending of mostly private money. This means that considerable political and civic effort must be made to produce the shift in transport mode seen in levels 3 and 4.\nWhen choosing the lever setting for “mode”, users should also consider their choices for “passenger distance”. For example, if passenger and freight distance are set at level 1 (very high growth), then setting mode at level 4 may be unrealistic because it tends to be more difficult to travel long distances by walking, cycling or public transport.\nThe user’s choice in the transport mode lever also affects the impact of the “electric and hydrogen” and “transport efficiency” levers – lowering the average emission factor of a car will make more of a difference if there are many cars.</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Car use continues to grow.
