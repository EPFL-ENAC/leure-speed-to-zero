Without the implementation of extensive and sustained mitigation, transport emissions could increase at a faster rate than emissions from the other energy end-use sectors. The transport sector is recognized as particularly difficult to decarbonize given the investment costs needed to build low-emissions transport systems or the slow turnover of stock and infrastructure. Accordingly, a shift towards demand-side solutions for mitigating climate change is now gaining traction.</p>\n      <p>The demand for passenger travel is controlled by the amount of time a person spends traveling and the average speed of transportation systems. There are three major activities that compose most of the time spent travelling; to go to work/study (depending on the age class), for recreation and social activities, and to access services like shopping or medical care. Growth in wealth is usually related to more time spent on travelling for leisure and social activities. The best opportunities to reduce travel demand therefore emerge by lowering the need to travel for work/study purposes (e.g. via teleworking or home-based work) and to access services (e.g. via automation or tele-medicine).</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Growth in travel distance per person continues to follow current trend mostly due to longer travel time dedicated to leisure activities, with time spent to go to work/study and access services also remaining unchanged.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>The growth in travel distance is conditioned by a 10% reduction in travel spent for traveling to work/study and to access services.
