There are several ways to enhance vehicle efficiency, such as improving the engine or aerodynamic performance of vehicles, using lighter materials to reduce the ratio weight per person, using less carbon intensive fuel or changes in driving behaviour (for example, braking less or travelling at lower speeds).</p>\n    <p>For freight transport, in 2011 light-duty vehicles had an efficiency of 10 litres gasoline equivalent (lge) per 100 km and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency was 32 lge per 100 km. The average global rate of improvement is 1-2% per year. International shipping is more efficient in fossil fuel use and is also compatible with biofuels. Recently, in 2018, the EC drafted the first ever truck CO2 emission standards that plans to reduce truck-related emissions by improving efficiency and increase the share of zero-emission vehicles in the truck fleet.</p>\n    <div>\n      <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>By 2050, trucks energy consumption (MJ/tkm) decreases by 10%, rail energy consumption by 10%, aviation and shipping energy consumption by 5%. </p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>By 2050, trucks energy consumption (MJ/tkm) decreases by 17%, rail energy consumption by 13%, aviation energy consumption by 7% and shipping energy consumption by 13%. </p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 3</div><p>By 2050, trucks energy consumption (MJ/tkm) decreases by 33%, rail energy consumption by 27%, aviation energy consumption by 15% and shipping energy consumption by 30%. </p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 4</div><p>By 2050, trucks energy consumption (MJ/tkm) decreases by 50%, rail energy consumption by 40%, aviation energy consumption by 22% and shipping energy consumption by 40%. </p></li></ul>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n      modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
