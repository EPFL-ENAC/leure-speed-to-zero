Indeed, the cake (livestock feed) demand is to a large extent supplied through import, possibly leading to deforestation, biodiversity erosion and CO2 emissions. Insect farming and algae-based meals are promising options to produce a large amount of feedstuff and byproducts while using limited amount of lands.</p>\n    <p>The ‘alternative protein source’ lever sets the use of alternative feedstuff for livestock including insect and algae-based meals. The lever considers the animal health and food output quality to set the maximum alternative feed intake for each livestock. The lever also unlocks the potential for bioenergy (e.g. microalgae oil) and organic-based fertilizer (i.e. insect manure).</p>\n    <div>\n      <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>The deployment of insect and microalgae-based meals does not occur, animal feed compounds remain the same as in 2015.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>The deployment of insect and microalgae meals occur in a modest extent.
