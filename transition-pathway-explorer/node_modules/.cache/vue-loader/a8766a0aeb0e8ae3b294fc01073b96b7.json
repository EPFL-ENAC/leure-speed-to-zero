The variation reflects the main driver for requiring cooling (high outside temperatures) although it is also noted that income levels also play a role.</p>\n    <p>For large parts of Europe, increases in cooling energy demand due to global warming is said to outweigh the expected reductions in energy for heating. Depending on the generation mix, in some countries, the net effect on CO2 emissions may be an increase even where overall demand for delivered energy is reduced. Given that a certain amount of global warming between today and 2050 is unavoidable (given the large amount of emissions already in the atmosphere), this lever considers that for any level an increase of cooled area in residential buildings is required.</p>\n    <div>\n      <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>In level 1 country-specific shares of cooled floor space are the same as those projected in the Heat Roadmap Europe project (https://heatroadmap.eu/).
