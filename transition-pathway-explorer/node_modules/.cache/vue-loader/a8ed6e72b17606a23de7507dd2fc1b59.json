Currently there are no large-scale CCS and CCU facilities in operation in EU28+Switzerland, despite some pilot projects. Several large-scale CCS projects are planned in 2020s (5 projects in the UK and 2 in Netherland). Compared to CCU, CCS requires less investment and energy consumption, while CCU contributes to the mitigation of fossil fuel demand and the alleviation of renewable intermittency by power-to-gas processes.</p>\n      <p>This lever defines two extreme scenarios, where only CCS (level 1) or only CCU (level 4) could be deployed. For some countries without geological availability for CCS, only CCU is assumed feasible. The other two levels are defined by linear interpolation between the two extreme scenarios, standing for a smooth transition from CCS to CCU.\nThe level 4 is assumed ambitious since the CCU has few advantages in terms of technological maturity and economic feasibility compared to CCS under the current energy system. However, the development of CCU is assumed promising in correspondence to the development of intermittent renewable resources due to its potential for contributing to increasing energy storage demand. The output synthetic natural gas can be easily injected in the existing natural gas infrastructure facilitating the coupling of various energy, transport and industry sectors. \nThis lever is highly linked to the CC ratio defined in Manufacturing and Supply respectively, which denote the total carbon capture amount by years. The captured carbon can only be sequestrated or used, taking into account the geological feasibility. By consequence, the final CCS and CCU amounts are determined by the three levers defined above.  </p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>All captured carbon is sequestrated underground from 2015-2050, no carbon is used to produce fuels.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>66% of captured carbon is sequestrated and the other 33% is used to produce synthetic natural gas.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 3</div><p>33% of captured carbon is sequestrated and the other 66% is used to produce synthetic natural gas.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 4</div><p>All the captured carbon is used to produce synthetic natural gas, no sequestration.</p></li></ul>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n        modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n",null]}
