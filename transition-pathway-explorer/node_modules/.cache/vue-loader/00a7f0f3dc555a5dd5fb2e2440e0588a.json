A higher GDP implies a higher level of production and consumption, which in turn translates into a higher demand for transporting the produced goods. Low-carbon scenarios that lean towards a local circular economy, based on sharing and where mobility is seen as service, could however decouple freight activity from GDP. In 2015, the energy demand for freight only represents a third of the energy consumption related to passenger transport in Europe. The proportion is similar for GHG emissions as well. However, as freight transportation modes are harder to decarbonize than passenger transportation modes (e.g. trucks vs. cars), the share of freight related GHG emissions in total transport GHG emissions is likely to increase.\"\n          )\n        ]),\n        _c(\"p\", [\n          _vm._v(\n            \"This lever is completely independent from other factors in the model: there is no link with GDP and circular economy is not modelled.
