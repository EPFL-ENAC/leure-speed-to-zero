Similarly, many freight transport vehicles are not loaded to their full capacity.\nHistorically, freight transport load factors have increased due to improved logistics and distribution systems. In contrast, car occupancy has decreased. An explanation might be the increasing global wealth allowing for more car ownership as well as the greater diversity of activities and destinations available to people. People who may have originally travelled as a group or used public transport, now go with their own cars.\nHowever, as awareness grows and congestion and parking costs increase in some urban areas, the use of car-pooling and car sharing may become a more appealing prospect in the future.</p>\n      <p>Increasing efforts on “occupancy” “occupancy and load” while at the same time addressing “passenger distance”, “freight distance” and “mode”, can considerably reduce transport energy demand and the number of vehicles required.\nCar sharing could be boosted in a number of different ways. Technological developments (such as smart phone apps) make it easier for people to coordinate ride-shares. Other initiatives can also be effective. Los Angeles, for instance, has lanes exclusively for high occupancy vehicles. In Italy, municipalities, in the presence of high levels of pollution have resorted to restrict access to the city center on certain days, based on car registration, forcing people to carpool more or switch to public transport.\nTechnological developments could also help increase freight load. For example, applications are available that ensure that a freight vehicle is as heavily loaded as possible during its journey.\n</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Under this scenario, people continue to prefer single-occupancy driving, public transport occupancy levels are relatively low.
