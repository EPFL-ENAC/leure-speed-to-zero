According to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, in 2015 128 reactors were in operation in the EU, of which almost half (58) were in France. In total, these 128 reactors have a capacity of 119.7 GW generating roughly a quarter of the electricity production in the EU. Nuclear power generation can significantly contribute to decarbonisation, offering emission free baseload power. However, due to different concerns, some countries have decided not to use it or to phase-out existing capacities. Through the settings, the user can choose the future of the base year nuclear generation capacities depending on the policy of the country. The impact of timing on phase-out and expansion can be investigated on pathways. Regardless of the nuclear policies of countries, level 1 equals to the lowest capacity or the quickest phase-out/slowest expansion, while level 4 pushes for the highest amount of nuclear as soon as possible.\"\n          )\n        ]),\n        _c(\"p\", [\n          _vm._v(\n            \"Due to ageing and phase-out policies, nuclear power generation is foreseen to decrease further in the EU, however, policies and plans vary between Member States.
