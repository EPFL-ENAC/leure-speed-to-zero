The proportion of trucks in the mix is particularly important, as trucks have high emissions per tonne-km compared to rail or sea. For freight, rail has a lower emissions factor per tonne-km, but will require a large infrastructure investment globally if it is to maintain its current share.</p>\n      <p>When choosing the lever setting for “mode”, users should also consider their choices for “freight distance”. For example, if d freight distance is set at level 1 (very high growth), then setting the “mode” lever at level 4, with larger shares for rail and internal waterways, may be unrealistic in terms of the absolute demand (in tonne-km) for these softer transportation modes (e.g. limited capacity of European internal waterways). \nThe user’s choice in the transport mode lever also affects the impact of the “electric and hydrogen” and “transport efficiency” levers – lowering the average emission factor of a truck will make more of a difference if there is a large truck fleet.</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>The modal shares in 2050 will be: 49% for trucks, 13% for rail, 4% for inland shipping, 34% for maritime shipping and 0.1% for aviation. </p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>The modal shares in 2050 will be: 45% for trucks, 17% for rail, 4% for inland shipping, 34% for maritime shipping.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 3</div><p>The modal shares in 2050 will be: 41% for trucks, 21% for rail, 4% for inland shipping, 34% for maritime shipping and 0.1% for aviation.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 4</div><p>The modal shares in 2050 will be: 35% for trucks, 24% for rail, 7% for inland shipping, 34% for maritime shipping and 0.1% for aviation. </p></li></ul>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n        modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n",null]}
