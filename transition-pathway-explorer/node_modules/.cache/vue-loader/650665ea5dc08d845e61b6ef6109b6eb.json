The installation of these technologies can in some cases play an important  role in decarbonization pathways. The reason for merging these three technologies into one lever is that the potential of adding new capacities is limited to only certain countries. As hydropower provides the largest source of renewable electricity production in the European Union, the hydropower market is highly developed. In 2015, the EU28+Switzerland had a total 120 GW of hydropower (excluding pumped storage) with 86 GW of that found in only 6 countries: Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Unlike hydropower, penetration of geothermal and marine energy capacities is low (neither of them reach 1 GW at EU level), as it is limited to countries with certain geographical and geological conditions. The term marine energy includes multiple technologies but the only significant installation within the  EU is found in France with 240 MW capacity. Also the bulk of geothermal capacities in the EU is limited to one country: Italy has 879 MW of geothermal electricity production. A few small plants ranging 1-27 MW are in Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal and Romania.</p>\n    <p>Investments in the hydropower sector are primarily focused on pumped storage projects, as it is currently the only flexible carbon free tool in the electricity system that exists in large scale. As such, in the architecture of the EUCalc, pumped storage capacities are considered in the storage module as a tool for system flexibility.</p>\n    <div>\n      <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Total hydropower, geothermal and marine capacities follow the current trends thus exceeding 100 GW by 2050.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>Total hydropower, geothermal and marine capacities are getting close to 200 GW by 2050.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 3</div><p>Total hydropower, geothermal and marine capacities exceed 200 GW by 2050.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 4</div><p>Total hydropower, geothermal and marine capacities are getting close to 300 GW by 2050.</p></li></ul>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n      modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
