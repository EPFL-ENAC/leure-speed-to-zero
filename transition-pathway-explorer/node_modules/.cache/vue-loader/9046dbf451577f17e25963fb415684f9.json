This is a level of income that would eliminate the monetary barrier of buying an appliance while containing the prospect of households buying more appliances than necessary. At this level, dishwasher ownership would converge towards 0.5 per household (the same as Italy in 2014); computer ownership would be at 1 per household (the same as Spain in 2014); TV’s would be at 1 per household (similar to the level of Slovenia in 2014).
