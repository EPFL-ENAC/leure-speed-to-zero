For example, in the steel industry the BF-BOF (blast furnace - basic oxygen furnace) route uses mainly coal for the steel production, while the scrap-EAF (electric arc furnaces) route uses mainly electricity.\nOne important decarbonisation option for the European manufacturing and production sectors is the substitution of fossil fuels used for energy and for feedstock, with low carbon alternatives. There are several possibilities to reach this goal. The first one is the electrification of heat, which can be obtained by replacing furnaces, boilers, heat pumps running on fossil fuels with electric ones. A second possibility is the use of zero-carbon hydrogen to replace certain fuels used for energy or feedstock and the last one is the switch to sustainable biomass.</p>\n      <p>The availability of low-cost zero-carbon electricity and biomass will influence the feasibility of these decarbonisation options. Availability can vary considerably among locations. Countries with high electricity prices and without biomass resources will have to rely on renewable electricity transmitted over long distances or imported biomass and zero-carbon hydrogen.\nIn the EUCalc model, the availability of biomass at a national level is determined by the Agriculture module and is based on the demand of transport, buildings, industry, and power sectors. If the biomass demand cannot be satisfied, a warning in the pathway explorer will signal it to the user.</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>The energy carrier mix in each industry typically varies from one technology to the other.
