The residence time of IT equipment reduced by 10% while washing machines and dishwashers 7%.\n</p>\n      <p>Traditionally, much more attention has been placed on the amount of energy used by a product rather than the amount of energy it took to produce it. But not all appliances are created equal. White appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines and dishwashers, require a significant amount of energy to produce but their overall (full life cycle) energy expenditure takes place during operation. Manufacturing of white appliances accounts for only up to 12% of the total lifetime energy use (Gonzalez et al., 2012). On the other hand, products with shorter useful lives as well as those with semiconductor manufacturing (e.g., electronics) tend to have much higher relative embedded energy and GHG emissions contribution compared to products with motors, pumps, or compressors (Weber 2011). Products such as computers have a higher proportion of their overall energy use tied to their production in the range of 40 to 80% of their total life cycle energy use. The more we use an appliance above and beyond its expected lifetime, the greater the potential savings. \n</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>In level 1 the replacement of appliances follows the trends suggested in Prakash et al., (2016) and Huisman et al., (2012) as indicative of current trends.
