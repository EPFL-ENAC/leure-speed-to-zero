As for the passenger transport, automation is expected to have a strong impact on the utilization of trucks.</p>\n      <p>Technological developments have also helped increase freight load, for example through applications and software, that ensure that a freight vehicle is as heavily loaded as possible during its journey.\nFor given settings of “freight distance” and “mode”, increasing the “load factor” will reduce transport energy demand and the number of vehicles required. Freight Load factor is expressed in tonne-km/vehicle-km. Then, through this lever, vehicle-kilometers are translated into number of vehicles. For the same vehicle distance, expressed in vehicle-kilometers, and the same lifetime, expressed in kilometers, a higher utilization rate will therefore be translated into a lower number of vehicles (that will however have to be replaced more often).</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Status quo with 2015.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 2</div><p>Trucks have a 5% higher load in 2050 with respect to 2015 and trucks will run 3% more km per year than in 2015.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 3</div><p>Trucks have a 10% higher load in 2050 with respect to 2015 and trucks will run 7% more km per year than in 2015.</p></li><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 4</div><p>Trucks have a 15% higher load in 2050 with respect to 2015 and trucks will run 10% more km per year than in 2015.</p></li></ul>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n        modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n",null]}
