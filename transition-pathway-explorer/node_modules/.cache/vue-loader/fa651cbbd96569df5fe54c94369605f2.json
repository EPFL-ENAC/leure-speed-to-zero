However, depending on the way they are produced, they can compete with other uses. For example, first generation biofuels based on crops directly compete with food production as the land used to produce crops intended for biofuels cannot be used for growing crops for food production. Hence, the use of biofuel might not always be sustainable.\n E-fuels are an interesting alternative to both conventional fuels and biofuels. Synthetic fuels are generated exclusively with renewable energy and are not technically different from their conventional counterparts (they can even be used in classic cars). However, producing synthetic fuels is currently a costly and non-efficient process, as production requires a lot of energy.</p>\n      <div>\n        <ul><li class=\"lever-info-amibitions\"><div> Ambition Level 1</div><p>Biofuels represent 7% of total road fuels in 2050, no biofuels for marine and aviation.
