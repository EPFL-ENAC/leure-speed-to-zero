Average per-capita residential floor area across the EU28 Member states increased from 36 to 45.5 m2 between the years 2000 and 2014. A decrease in the intensity (that is, less floor space per person) would therefore yield reductions on the total amount of energy requirements for the heating of buildings.

Rao and Min (2018) suggest the value of 37 m2/cap (that of Chinaâ€™s average home size in urban areas and similar to that in the EU28 in the year 2000) as the benchmark for decent living in affluent countries. In Korea, an affluent country with living standards on par with rich European countries, the minimum standard for living space is 12 m2 for one person (Rao and Min 2018). Showing that in some geographic contexts a very low floor-space per person is possible, even when the country is affluent.\n</p></li></ul>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        For more details on the definition of the ambition levels for this lever and on the context and\n        modelling assumptions, please refer to the <a href=\"http://www.european-calculator.eu/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>technical documentation</b></a>.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n",null]}
