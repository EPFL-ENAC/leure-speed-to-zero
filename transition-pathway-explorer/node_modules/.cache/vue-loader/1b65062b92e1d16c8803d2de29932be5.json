These technologies can have very different efficiencies and emissions associated with them. Today, the most common forms of heating in urban areas are district heating and gas boilers. In rural areas, solid fuel boilers are most common. The fossil fuel share for heating buildings (excluding electricity and district heating) is about 40% across Europe.</p>\n      <p>National policies on fossil fuel phase out may impact the evolution of the energy carriers and the technologies used for heating. The phased out fossil fuels will be replaced with alternative technologies, which are also covered by this lever.
