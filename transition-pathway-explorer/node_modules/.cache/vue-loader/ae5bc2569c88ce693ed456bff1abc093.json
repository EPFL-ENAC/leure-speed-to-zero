All these parameters set out the energy performance of the building envelope and are reflected through the lever, which includes not only changes in wall/roof insulation but also alterations in the quality of windows and doors as well as glass type. A change in the energy performance of the building envelope can be achieved through a renovation improving building components. The average renovation rate in Europe is currently about 1%, which would leave large parts of the buildings stock unchanged until 2050. The most ambitious choice for the Level 4 renovation rate is 3% which would allow some buildings to be improved twice by then. How energy efficient are the renovated buildings considered in three renovation categories: shallow, medium and deep? They reduce the energy need (useful energy demand) of the building by 30%, 40% and 60% respectively. This lever also determines the mix of renovations with respect to this ambition. \\nSimilarly, new buildings are represented by a spread between new constructed buildings of low, medium and high efficiency. These buildings have an energy need (useful energy) of 70%, 60% and 40% of the average building stock. Please note that the energy need is different from the final energy demand /delivered energy. The latter is determined by the combination of the building envelope and the choice of technology and energy carrier. \\nBuildings that have an energy need above zero can still have a final energy demand of zero when combined with suitable technologies, which is possible with the technology and fuels lever. \\nThe graph exemplifies the energy performance improvement of the building envelopes of the whole building stock, resulting from a combination of renovation rate and a mix of renovation ambitions.\\n\"\n          )\n        ]),\n        _vm._m(1),\n        _vm._m(2)\n      ],\n      1\n    )\n  ])\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = [\n  function() {\n    var _vm = this\n    var _h = _vm.$createElement\n    var _c = _vm._self._c || _h\n    return _c(\"div\", { attrs: { id: \"lever-info-header\" } }, [\n      _c(\"h3\", { attrs: { id: \"lever-info-title\" } }, [\n        _vm._v(\"Building envelope\")\n      ])\n    ])\n  },\n  function() {\n    var _vm = this\n    var _h = _vm.$createElement\n    var _c = _vm._self._c || _h\n    return _c(\"div\", [\n      _c(\"ul\", [\n        _c(\"li\", { staticClass: \"lever-info-amibitions\" }, [\n          _c(\"div\", [_vm._v(\" Ambition Level 1\")]),\n          _c(\"p\", [\n            _vm._v(\n              \"The annual renovation rate is 1%. 80% of the renovations are shallow (-30% energy demand), 15% are medium (-40%) and 5% are deep (-60%). 80% of new constructions have the lowest level of efficiency, 15% are medium efficient and 5%  highly efficient.
