# fleet (t) = fleet (t-1) - waste (t) + new (t)
# waste (t) = fleet (t-1) - fleet (t) + new (t)
# ren rate (t-1) = waste (t) / fleet (t-1)
# when waste is negative, it should be assigned a zero, and new registrations should
# be adjusted to be equal the difference between stock t and stock t-1
# probably all fts should be done after this adjustment is done

# Paola does this in compute_renewal_rate_and_adjust(). The logic is obtain waste from
# equation above, and then do readjustments on stocks. On Monday:
# - re-organize all files to have only OTS (re-save all data matrices etc in riorganised folders)
# - get this function going with your data
# - write a file for FTS
