# NOTE: data on material production, for both modelled and non-modelled materials, are currently
# done in "industry_lever_material-net-import", as they are inferred from the 
# database ds-056120. At this stage, we did not use the database ds-056121, as data
# availability is low. Finally, note that material production for non-modelled materials
# (the ones mentioned above) currently enters as a fixed assumption, while 
# material production for all materials (modelled and non-modelled) can be used
# for calibration (TBD).
